After unpacking, run "./configure" in this directory.  If you want to
install somewhere other than the default place (usually /usr/local),
do "./configure --prefix=/my/directory".  Then type "make install".

As well as the rxp binary, a library, a man page, and several C header
files will be installed.

[If you've checked this out of CVS instead of getting a distribution
tar file, you probably want to start by running "autoreconf -i".]
