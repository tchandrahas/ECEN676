There's no news.

This is basically just md5sum and sha*sum taken from GNU coreutils, wrapped
up in a more minimal extraction of GNUlib, and repackaged.

The programs have been patched to be able to recurse into directories when
generating sums (which is handy on Windows), and also to be able to generate
an "extended" format which outputs the file size as well as the checksum.
When checking files, the size is compared first and the file isn't even read
if the sizes don't match.  That's okay, because it treats all files as
binary.
