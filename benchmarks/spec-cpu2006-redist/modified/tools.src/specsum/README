These notes by Cloyce Spradling, spring 2011, (edited by johnh, but the word
"I" here means "Cloyce", unless he takes steps to deny it)

This is specmd5sum [and also specsha*sum, which, as of mid-2011, are 
built but are not incorporated into the binary tools tarballs].  

See the NEWS file for info about origins, etc.

Hopefully YOU will never be tasked with updating these programs.  The
easy way out would be to just copy in the latest GNU coreutils package
and call it good, but that way lies bloat and failed tests.

To avoid situations like that, just update the md5sum sources from
coreutils and update the GNUlib bits separately.

There are only two files taken from coreutils: md5sum.c and system.h, 
which are used build the several variations (by setting 
-DHASH_ALGO_xx to MD5, SHA512, SHA384, etc)

What I'd do (if I have to do this again) is diff SPEC's versions of those
files against the version of coreutils from which they were taken (see
redistributable_sources/original/tools.src/coreutils-8.9.tar.xz and
attempt to apply SPEC's diffs to the new versions of the files.

If you're lucky and coreutils hasn't changed much, that might be all
that's necessary.  Otherwise, you'll get to hone your code maintenance
skills a bit.

After the changes are all re-applied, check out a copy of GNUlib (there is no
downloadable tarball) and put it in $SPEC/tools/src/gnulib.  Then just run
'./bootstrap', fix up the Subversion stuff (delete deleted files, add new
files) and check it all in.  The GNUlib used for this version was checked out
on 28 Feb 2011 and updated once or twice before everything was finally done.
