All of the include files in the mingw/ subdirectory were generated using
the standard build system on a system with both MinGW GCC and MSYS installed.
Normally you'd think that this would be the way to go (hey, just use
the regular old buildtools!), and normally you'd be right... But in this case
we don't want to have dependencies on DLLs distributed only with MSYS.

The MinGW-specific Makefile is pretty simple (except for the pattern rules
that enable building all the binaries) and was constructed by observing
the output of make from the MSYS build.

Other than the GNUlib stuff, the Windows emulation of dirent (dirent.[ch])
was taken from the GNU make 3.82 distribution.  dirent.h was modified
slightly because it assumed that MinGW ==> MSYS, which is not true.
