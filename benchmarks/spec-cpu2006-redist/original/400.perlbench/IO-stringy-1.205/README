NAME
    IO-stringy - I/O on in-core objects like strings and arrays

SYNOPSIS
        IO::
        ::AtomicFile   adpO  Write a file which is updated atomically     ERYQ
        ::Lines        bdpO  I/O handle to read/write to array of lines   ERYQ
        ::Scalar       RdpO  I/O handle to read/write to a string         ERYQ
        ::ScalarArray  RdpO  I/O handle to read/write to array of scalars ERYQ
        ::Wrap         RdpO  Wrap old-style FHs in standard OO interface  ERYQ
        ::WrapTie      adpO  Tie your handles & retain full OO interface  ERYQ

DESCRIPTION
    This toolkit primarily provides modules for performing both traditional
    and object-oriented i/o) on things *other* than normal filehandles; in
    particular, the IO::Scalar manpage, the IO::ScalarArray manpage, and the
    IO::Lines manpage.

    If you have access to tie(), these classes will make use of the the
    IO::WrapTie manpage module to inherit a convenient new_tie()
    constructor. It also exports a nice wraptie() function.

    In the more-traditional IO::Handle front, we have the IO::AtomicFile
    manpage which may be used to painlessly create files which are updated
    atomically.

    And in the "this-may-prove-useful" corner, we have the IO::Wrap manpage,
    whose exported wraphandle() function will clothe anything that's not a
    blessed object in an IO::Handle-like wrapper... so you can just use OO
    syntax and stop worrying about whether your function's caller handed you
    a string, a globref, or a FileHandle.

INSTALLATION
    You know the drill...

        perl Makefile.PL
        make test
        make install
