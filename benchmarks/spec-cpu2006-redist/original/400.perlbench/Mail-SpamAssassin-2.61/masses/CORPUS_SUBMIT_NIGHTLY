How To Submit Nightly Mass-check Results
========================================


The first time you do this: check out the CVS version of SpamAssassin, using
"CURRENT_CORPORA_SUBMIT_VERSION" as a tag:

  cd /home/you/directory
  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.spamassassin.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/spamassassin \
                login
  cvs -d:pserver:anonymous@cvs.spamassassin.sourceforge.net:/cvsroot/spamassassin \
                co -r CURRENT_CORPORA_SUBMIT_VERSION spamassassin


Every night from then on, check out the correct version of SpamAssassin.  This
is tagged nightly using "CURRENT_CORPORA_SUBMIT_VERSION":

  cd /home/you/directory/spamassassin
  cvs -z3 update -dP -r CURRENT_CORPORA_SUBMIT_VERSION


Next, cd to the "masses" subdir and create a new pair of mass-check logfiles
using that tag.

  cd /home/you/directory/spamassassin/masses
  rm ham.log spam.log
  touch ham.log spam.log


Run all your mass-check scripts into those logfiles.  This is up to you!


Finally submit them to rsync.spamassassin.org.  Replace "you" with the username
you received (see CORPUS_SUBMIT for info), ditto for the password.

  RSYNC_PASSWORD="[whatever your password is]"
  export RSYNC_PASSWORD
  rsync -CPcvzb ham.log you@rsync.spamassassin.org::corpus/ham-you.log
  rsync -CPcvzb spam.log you@rsync.spamassassin.org::corpus/spam-you.log


That's it.
