Date: Fri, 23 Nov 2001 09:27:09 +0100

On request I've made a .patch file to qmail-scanner-queue.template in the
qmail-scanner 1.01 distribution. I hope it's a correct one, I never done it
before

If you're going to use it, don't forget the edit the $spam_rec variable !!!
Also if something goes wrong, put the Debug option on and tail the logfile, my
patch is quite verbose.  And check your mail-headers in the processed messages
for an X-Spam entry.
