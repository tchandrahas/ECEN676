.SH DESCRIPTION
editconf converts generic structure format to 
.B .gro
, 
.B .g96

or 
.B .pdb
.



The box can be modified with options 
.B -box
, 
.B -d
and

.B -angles
. Both 
.B -box
and 
.B -d

will center the system in the box.



Option 
.B -bt
determines the box type: 
.B tric
is a
triclinic box, 
.B cubic
is a cubic box, 
.B dodecahedron
is
a rhombic dodecahedron and 
.B octahedron
is a truncated octahedron.
The last two are special cases of a triclinic box.
The length of the three box vectors of the truncated octahedron is the
shortest distance between two opposite hexagons.
The volume of a dodecahedron is 0.71 and that of a truncated octahedron
is 0.77 of that of a cubic box with the same periodic image distance.



Option 
.B -box
requires only
one value for a cubic box, dodecahedron and a truncated octahedron.
With 
.B -d
and 
.B tric
the size of the system in the x, y
and z directions is used. With 
.B -d
and 
.B cubic
,

.B dodecahedron
or 
.B octahedron
the diameter of the system
is used, which is the largest distance between two atoms.



Option 
.B -angles
is only meaningful with option 
.B -box
and
a triclinic box and can not be used with option 
.B -d
.



When 
.B -n
or 
.B -ndef
is set, a group
can be selected for calculating the size and the geometric center,
otherwise the whole system is used.




.B -rotate
rotates the coordinates and velocities.

.B -princ
aligns the principal axes of the system along the
coordinate axes, this may allow you to decrease the box volume,
but beware that molecules can rotate significantly in a nanosecond.


Scaling is applied before any of the other operations are
performed. Boxes can be scaled to give a certain density (option

.B -density
). A special feature of the scaling option, when the
factor -1 is given in one dimension, one obtains a mirror image,
mirrored in one of the plains, when one uses -1 in three dimensions
a point-mirror image is obtained.


Groups are selected after all operations have been applied.


Periodicity can be removed in a crude manner.
It is important that the box sizes at the bottom of your input file
are correct when the periodicity is to be removed.



The program can optionally rotate the solute molecule to align the
molecule along its principal axes (
.B -rotate
)



When writing 
.B .pdb
files, B-factors can be
added with the 
.B -bf
option. B-factors are read
from a file with with following format: first line states number of
entries in the file, next lines state an index
followed by a B-factor. The B-factors will be attached per residue
unless an index is larger than the number of residues or unless the

.B -atom
option is set. Obviously, any type of numeric data can
be added instead of B-factors. 
.B -legend
will produce
a row of CA atoms with B-factors ranging from the minimum to the
maximum value found, effectively making a legend for viewing.



With the option -mead a special pdb file for the MEAD electrostatics
program (Poisson-Boltzmann solver) can be made. A further prerequisite
is that the input file is a run input file.
The B-factor field is then filled with the Van der Waals radius
of the atoms while the occupancy field will hold the charge.



The option -grasp is similar, but it puts the charges in the B-factor
and the radius in the occupancy.



Finally with option 
.B -label
editconf can add a chain identifier
to a pdb file, which can be useful for analysis with e.g. rasmol.


To convert a truncated octrahedron file produced by a package which uses
a cubic box with the corners cut off (such as Gromos) use:


.B editconf -f in -rotate 0 -45 -35.264 -bt o -box veclen -o out


where 
.B veclen
is the size of the cubic box times sqrt(3)/2.
