.SH DESCRIPTION
g_analyze reads an ascii file and analyzes data sets.
A line in the input file may start with a time
(see option 
.B -time
) and any number of y values may follow.
Multiple sets can also be
read when they are seperated by & (option 
.B -n
),
in this case only one y value is read from each line.
All lines starting with  and @ are skipped.
All analyses can also be done for the derivative of a set
(option 
.B -d
).


All options, except for 
.B -av
and 
.B -power
assume that the
points are equidistant in time.


g_analyze always shows the average and standard deviation of each
set. For each set it also shows the relative deviation of the third
and forth cumulant from those of a Gaussian distribution with the same
standard deviation.


Option 
.B -ac
produces the autocorrelation function(s).


Option 
.B -cc
plots the resemblance of set i with a cosine of
i/2 periods. The formula is:
2 (int0-T y(t) cos(pi t/i) dt)2 / int0-T y(t) y(t) dt

This is useful for principal components obtained from covariance
analysis, since the principal components of random diffusion are
pure cosines.


Option 
.B -msd
produces the mean square displacement(s).


Option 
.B -dist
produces distribution plot(s).


Option 
.B -av
produces the average over the sets.
Error bars can be added with the option 
.B -errbar
.
The errorbars can represent the standard deviation, the error
(assuming the points are independent) or the interval containing
90% of the points, by discarding 5% of the points at the top and
the bottom.


Option 
.B -ee
produces error estimates using block averaging.
A set is divided in a number of blocks and averages are calculated for
each block. The error for the total average is calculated from
the variance between averages of the m blocks B_i as follows:
error2 = Sum (B_i - B)2 / (m*(m-1)).
These errors are plotted as a function of the block size.
Also an analytical block average curve is plotted, assuming
that the autocorrelation is a sum of two exponentials.
The analytical curve for the block average BA is:

BA(t) = sigma sqrt(2/T (  a   (tau1 ((exp(-t/tau1) - 1) tau1/t + 1)) +

                        (1-a) (tau2 ((exp(-t/tau2) - 1) tau2/t + 1)))),
where T is the total time.
a, tau1 and tau2 are obtained by fitting BA(t) to the calculated block
average.
When the actual block average is very close to the analytical curve,
the error is sigma*sqrt(2/T (a tau1 + (1-a) tau2)).


Option 
.B -power
fits the data to b ta, which is accomplished
by fitting to a t + b on log-log scale. All points after the first
zero or negative value are ignored.
