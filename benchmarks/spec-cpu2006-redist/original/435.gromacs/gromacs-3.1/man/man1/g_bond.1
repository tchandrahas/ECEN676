.SH DESCRIPTION
g_bond makes a distribution of bond lengths. If all is well a
gaussian distribution should be made when using a harmonic potential.
bonds are read from a single group in the index file in order i1-j1
i2-j2 thru in-jn.



.B -tol
gives the half-width of the distribution as a fraction
of the bondlength (
.B -blen
). That means, for a bond of 0.2
a tol of 0.1 gives a distribution from 0.18 to 0.22.


Option 
.B -d
plots all the distances as a function of time.
This requires a structure file for the atom and residue names in
the output.
