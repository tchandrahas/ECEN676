.SH DESCRIPTION
g_dih can do two things. The default is to analyze dihedral transitions
by merely computing all the dihedral angles defined in your topology
for the whole trajectory. When a dihedral flips over to another minimum
an angle/time plot is made.


The opther option is to discretize the dihedral space into a number of
bins, and group each conformation in dihedral space in the
appropriate bin. The output is then given as a number of dihedral
conformations sorted according to occupancy.
