.SH DESCRIPTION
g_dipoles computes the total dipole plus fluctuations of a simulation
system. From this you can compute e.g. the dielectric constant for
low dielectric media


The file dip.xvg contains the total dipole moment of a frame, the
components as well as the norm of the vector.
The file aver.xvg contains  |Mu|2  and  |Mu| 2 during the
simulation.
The file dip.xvg contains the distribution of dipole moments during
the simulation
The mu_max is used as the highest value in the distribution graph.


Furthermore the dipole autocorrelation function will be computed, when
option -c is used. It can be averaged over all molecules, 
or (with option -avercorr) it can be computed as the autocorrelation
of the total dipole moment of the simulation box.


At the moment the dielectric constant is calculated only correct if
a rectangular or cubic simulation box is used.


Option 
.B -g
produces a plot of the distance dependent Kirkwood
G-factor, as well as the average cosine of the angle between the dipoles
as a function of the distance. The plot also includes gOO and hOO
according to Nymand & Linse, JCP 112 (2000) pp 6386-6395. In the same plot
we also include the energy per scale computed by taking the inner product of
the dipoles divided by the distance to the third power.





EXAMPLES


g_dipoles -P1 -n mols -o dip_sqr -mu 2.273 -mumax 5.0
-nofft


This will calculate the autocorrelation function of the molecular
dipoles using a first order Legendre polynomial of the angle of the
dipole vector and itself a time t later. For this calculation 1001
frames will be used. Further the dielectric constant will be calculated
using an epsilonRF of infinity (default), temperature of 300 K (default) and
an average dipole moment of the molecule of 2.273 (SPC). For the
distribution function a maximum of 5.0 will be used.
