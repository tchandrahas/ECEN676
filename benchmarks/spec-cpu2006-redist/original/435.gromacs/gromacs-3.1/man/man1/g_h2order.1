.SH DESCRIPTION
Compute the orientation of water molecules with respect to the normal
of the box. The program determines the average cosine of the angle
between de dipole moment of water and an axis of the box. The box is
divided in slices and the average orientation per slice is printed.
Each water molecule is assigned to a slice, per time frame, based on the
position of the oxygen. When -nm  is used the angle between the water
dipole and the axis from the center of mass to the oxygen is calculated
instead of the angle between the dipole and a box axis.

 Take the normal on the membrane in direction X, Y or Z.

.BI "-sl"  " int" " 0" 
 Calculate order parameter as function of boxlength, dividing the box in nr slices.

\- The program assigns whole water molecules to a slice, based on the firstatom of three in the index file group. It assumes an order O,H,H.Name is not important, but the order is. If this demand is not met,assigning molecules to slices is different.
