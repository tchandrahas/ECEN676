.SH DESCRIPTION
g_helix computes all kind of helix properties. First, the peptide
is checked to find the longest helical part. This is determined by
Hydrogen bonds and Phi/Psi angles.
That bit is fitted
to an ideal helix around the Z-axis and centered around the origin.
Then the following properties are computed:



.B 1.
Helix radius (file radius.xvg). This is merely the
RMS deviation in two dimensions for all Calpha atoms.
it is calced as sqrt((SUM i(x2(i)+y2(i)))/N), where N is the number
of backbone atoms. For an ideal helix the radius is 0.23 nm


.B 2.
Twist (file twist.xvg). The average helical angle per
residue is calculated. For alpha helix it is 100 degrees,
for 3-10 helices it will be smaller,
for 5-helices it will be larger.


.B 3.
Rise per residue (file rise.xvg). The helical rise per
residue is plotted as the difference in Z-coordinate between Ca
atoms. For an ideal helix this is 0.15 nm


.B 4.
Total helix length (file len-ahx.xvg). The total length
of the
helix in nm. This is simply the average rise (see above) times the
number of helical residues (see below).


.B 5.
Number of helical residues (file n-ahx.xvg). The title says
it all.


.B 6.
Helix Dipole, backbone only (file dip-ahx.xvg).


.B 7.
RMS deviation from ideal helix, calculated for the Calpha
atoms only (file rms-ahx.xvg).


.B 8.
Average Calpha-Calpha dihedral angle (file phi-ahx.xvg).


.B 9.
Average Phi and Psi angles (file phipsi.xvg).


.B 10.
Ellipticity at 222 nm according to 
.I Hirst and Brooks
