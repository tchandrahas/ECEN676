.SH DESCRIPTION
g_mindist computes the distance between one group and a number of
other groups.
Both the minimum distance and the number of contacts within a given
distance are written to two separate output files.


With option 
.B -pi
the minimum distance of a group to its
periodic image is plotted. This is useful for checking if a protein
has seen its periodic image during a simulation. Only one shift in
each direction is considered, giving a total of 26 shifts.
It also plots the maximum distance within the group and the lengths
of the three box vectors. This option is very slow.


Other programs that calculate distances are 
.B g_dist

and 
.B g_bond
