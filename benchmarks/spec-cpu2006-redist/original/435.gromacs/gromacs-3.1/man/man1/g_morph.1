.SH DESCRIPTION
g_morph does a linear interpolation of conformations in order to
create intermediates. Of course these are completely unphysical, but
that you may try to justify yourself. Output is in the form of a 
generic trajectory. The number of intermediates can be controlled with
the -ninterm flag. The first and last flag correspond to the way of
interpolating: 0 corresponds to input structure 1 while
1 corresponds to input strucutre 2.
If you specify first  0 or last  1 extrapolation will be
on the path from input structure x1 to x2. In general the coordinates
of the intermediate x(i) out of N total intermidates correspond to:


x(i) = x1 + (first+(i/(N-1))*(last-first))*(x2-x1)


Finally the RMSD with respect to both input structures can be computed
if explicitly selected (-or option). In that case an index file may be
read to select what group RMS is computed from.
