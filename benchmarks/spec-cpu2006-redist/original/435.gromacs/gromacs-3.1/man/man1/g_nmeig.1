.SH DESCRIPTION
g_nmeig calculates the eigenvectors/values of a (Hessian) matrix,
which can be calculated with 
.B nmrun
.
The eigenvectors are written to a trajectory file (
.B -v
).
The structure is written first with t=0. The eigenvectors
are written as frames with the eigenvector number as timestamp.
The eigenvectors can be analyzed with 
.B g_anaeig
.
An ensemble of structures can be generated from the eigenvectors with

.B g_nmens
.

.SH OTHER OPTIONS
.BI "-[no]h"  "    no"
 Print help info and quit

.BI "-[no]X"  "    no"
 Use dialog box GUI to edit command line options

.BI "-nice"  " int" " 19" 
 Set the nicelevel

.BI "-[no]m"  "   yes"
 Divide elements of Hessian by product of sqrt(mass) of involved atoms prior to diagonalization. This should be used for 'Normal Modes' analysis

.BI "-first"  " int" " 1" 
 First eigenvector to write away

.BI "-last"  " int" " 100" 
 Last eigenvector to write away
