.SH DESCRIPTION
g_rmsdist computes the root mean square deviation of atom distances,
which has the advantage that no fit is needed like in standard RMS
deviation as computed by g_rms.
The reference structure is taken from the structure file.
The rmsd at time t is calculated as the rms
of the differences in distance between atom-pairs in the reference
structure and the structure at time t.


g_rmsdist can also produce matrices of the rms distances, rms distances
scaled with the mean distance and the mean distances and matrices with
NMR averaged distances (1/r3 and 1/r6 averaging). Finally, lists
of atom pairs with 1/r3 and 1/r6 averaged distance below the
maximum distance (
.B -max
, which will default to 0.6 in this case)
can be generated, by default averaging over equivalent hydrogens
(all triplets of hydrogens named *[123]). Additionally a list of
equivalent atoms can be supplied (
.B -equiv
), each line containing
a set of equivalent atoms specified as residue number and name and
atom name; e.g.:



.B 3 SER  HB1 3 SER  HB2



Residue and atom names must exactly match those in the structure
file, including case. Specifying non-sequential atoms is undefined.
