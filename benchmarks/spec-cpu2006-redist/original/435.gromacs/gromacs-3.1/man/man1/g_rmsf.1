.SH DESCRIPTION
g_rmsf computes the root mean square fluctuation (RMSF, i.e. standard 
deviation) of atomic positions 
after first fitting to a reference frame.


With option 
.B -oq
the RMSF values are converted to B-factor
values, which are written to a pdb file with the coordinates, of the
structure file, or of a pdb file when 
.B -q
is specified.
Option 
.B -ox
writes the B-factors to a file with the average
coordinates.


With the option 
.B -od
the root mean square deviation with
respect to the reference structure is calculated.


With the option 
.B aniso
g_rmsf will compute anisotropic
temperature factors and then it will also output average coordinates
and a pdb file with ANISOU records (corresonding to the 
.B -oq

or 
.B -ox
option). Please note that the U values
are orientation dependent, so before comparison with experimental data
you should verify that you fit to the experimental coordinates.


When a pdb input file is passed to the program and the 
.B -aniso

flag is set
a correlation plot of the Uij will be created, if any anisotropic
temperature factors are present in the pdb file.


With option 
.B -dir
the average MSF (3x3) matrix is diagonalized.
This shows the directions in which the atoms fluctuate the most and
the least.
