.SH DESCRIPTION
Genbox can do one of 3 things:


1) Generate a box of solvent. Specify -cs and -box. Or specify -cs and
-cp with a structure file with a box, but without atoms.


2) Solvate a solute configuration, eg. a protein, in a bath of solvent 
molecules. Specify 
.B -cp
(solute) and 
.B -cs
(solvent). 
The box specified in the solute coordinate file (
.B -cp
) is used,
unless 
.B -box
is set, which also centers the solute.
The program 
.B editconf
has more sophisticated options to change
the box and center the solute.
Solvent molecules are removed from the box where the 
distance between any atom of the solute molecule(s) and any atom of 
the solvent molecule is less than the sum of the VanderWaals radii of 
both atoms. A database (
.B vdwradii.dat
) of VanderWaals radii is 
read by the program, atoms not in the database are 
assigned a default distance 
.B -vdw
.


3) Insert a number (
.B -nmol
) of extra molecules (
.B -ci
) 
at random positions.
The program iterates until 
.B nmol
molecules
have been inserted in the box. To test whether an insertion is 
successful the same VanderWaals criterium is used as for removal of 
solvent molecules. When no appropriately 
sized holes (holes that can hold an extra molecule) are available the 
program tries for 
.B -nmol
* 
.B -try
times before giving up. 
Increase -try if you have several small holes to fill.


The default solvent is Simple Point Charge water (SPC), with coordinates 
from 
.B $GMXLIB/spc216.gro
. Other
solvents are also supported, as well as mixed solvents. The
only restriction to solvent types is that a solvent molecule consists
of exactly one residue. The residue information in the coordinate
files is used, and should therefore be more or less consistent.
In practice this means that two subsequent solvent molecules in the 
solvent coordinate file should have different residue number.
The box of solute is built by stacking the coordinates read from
the coordinate file. This means that these coordinates should be 
equlibrated in periodic boundary conditions to ensure a good
alignment of molecules on the stacking interfaces.


The program can optionally rotate the solute molecule to align the
longest molecule axis along a box edge. This way the amount of solvent
molecules necessary is reduced.
It should be kept in mind that this only works for
short simulations, as eg. an alpha-helical peptide in solution can 
rotate over 90 degrees, within 500 ps. In general it is therefore 
better to make a more or less cubic box.


Setting -shell larger than zero will place a layer of water of
the specified thickness (nm) around the solute. Hint: it is a good
idea to put the protein in the center of a box first (using editconf).



Finally, genbox will optionally remove lines from your topology file in 
which a number of solvent molecules is already added, and adds a 
line with the total number of solvent molecules in your coordinate file.
