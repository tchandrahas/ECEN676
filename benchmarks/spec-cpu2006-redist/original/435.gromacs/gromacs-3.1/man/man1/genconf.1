.SH DESCRIPTION
genconf multiplies a given coordinate file by simply stacking them
on top of each other, like a small child playing with wooden blocks.
The program makes a grid of 
.I user defined

proportions (
.B -nbox
), 
and interspaces the grid point with an extra space 
.B -dist
.


When option 
.B -rot
is used the program does not check for overlap
between molecules on grid points. It is recommended to make the box in
the input file at least as big as the coordinates + 
Van der Waals radius.


If the optional trajectory file is given, conformations are not
generated, but read from this file and translated appropriately to
build the grid.

.SH OTHER OPTIONS
.BI "-[no]h"  "    no"
 Print help info and quit

.BI "-[no]X"  "    no"
 Use dialog box GUI to edit command line options

.BI "-nice"  " int" " 0" 
 Set the nicelevel

.BI "-nbox"  " vector" " 1 1 1" 
 Number of boxes

.BI "-dist"  " vector" " 0 0 0" 
 Distance between boxes

.BI "-seed"  " int" " 0" 
 Random generator seed, if 0 generated from the time

.BI "-[no]rot"  "    no"
 Randomly rotate conformations

.BI "-[no]shuffle"  "    no"
 Random shuffling of molecules

.BI "-[no]sort"  "    no"
 Sort molecules on X coord

.BI "-block"  " int" " 1" 
 Divide the box in blocks on this number of cpus

.BI "-nmolat"  " int" " 3" 
 Number of atoms per molecule, assumed to start from 0. If you set this wrong, it will screw up your system!

.BI "-maxrot"  " vector" " 90 90 90" 
 Maximum random rotation

.BI "-[no]renumber"  "    no"
 Renumber residues

\- The program should allow for random displacement off lattice points.
