.SH DESCRIPTION
genpr produces an include file for a topology containing
a list of atom numbers and three force constants for the
X, Y and Z direction. A single isotropic force constant may
be given on the command line instead of three components.


WARNING: genpr only works for the first molecule.
Position restraints are interactions within molecules, therefore
they should be included within the correct 
.B [ moleculetype ]

block in the topology. Since the atom numbers in every moleculetype
in the topology start at 1 and the numbers in the input file for
genpr number consecutively from 1, genpr will only produce a useful
file for the first molecule.
