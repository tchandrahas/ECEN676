.SH DESCRIPTION
ngmx is the Gromacs trajectory viewer. This program reads a
trajectory file, a run input file and an index file and plots a
3D structure of your molecule on your standard X Window
screen. No need for a high end graphics workstation, it even
works on Monochrome screens.


The following features have been implemented:
3D view, rotation, translation and scaling of your molecule(s),
labels on atoms, animation of trajectories,
hardcopy in PostScript format, user defined atom-filters
runs on MIT-X (real X), open windows and motif,
user friendly menus, option to remove periodicity, option to
show computational box.


Some of the more common X command line options can be used:

-bg, -fg change colors, -font fontname, changes the font.
