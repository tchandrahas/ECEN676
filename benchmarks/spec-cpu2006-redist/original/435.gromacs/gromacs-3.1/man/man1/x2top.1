.SH DESCRIPTION
x2top generates a primitive topology from a coordinate file.
The program assumes all hydrogens are present when defining
the hybridization from the atom name and the number of bonds.
The program can also make an rtp entry, which you can then add
to the rtp database.


When 
.B -param
is set, equilibrium distances and angles
and force constants will be printed in the topology for all
interactions. The equilibrium distances and angles are taken
from the input coordinates, the force constant are set with
command line options.

.SH OTHER OPTIONS
.BI "-[no]h"  "    no"
 Print help info and quit

.BI "-[no]X"  "    no"
 Use dialog box GUI to edit command line options

.BI "-nice"  " int" " 0" 
 Set the nicelevel

.BI "-scale"  " real" "    1.1" 
 Scaling factor for bonds with unknown atom types relative to atom type O

.BI "-nexcl"  " int" " 3" 
 Number of exclusions

.BI "-[no]H14"  "    no"
 Use 3rd neighbour interactions for hydrogen atoms

.BI "-[no]alldih"  "    no"
 Generate all proper dihedrals

.BI "-[no]pairs"  "   yes"
 Output 1-4 interactions (pairs) in topology file

.BI "-name"  " string" " ICE" 
 Name of your molecule

.BI "-[no]pbc"  "   yes"
 Use periodic boundary conditions. Please set the GMXFULLPBC environment variable as well.

.BI "-[no]param"  "    no"
 Print parameters in the output

.BI "-[no]round"  "   yes"
 Round off measured values

.BI "-kb"  " real" " 400000" 
 Bonded force constant (kJ/mol/nm2)

.BI "-kt"  " real" "    400" 
 Angle force constant (kJ/mol/rad2)

.BI "-kp"  " real" "      5" 
 Dihedral angle force constant (kJ/mol/rad2)

\- The atom type selection is primitive. Virtually no chemical knowledge is used

\- Periodic boundary conditions screw up the bonding

\- No improper dihedrals are generated

\- The atoms to atomtype translation table is incomplete (ffG43a1.n2t file in the $GMXLIB directory). Please extend it and send the results back to the GROMACS crew.
