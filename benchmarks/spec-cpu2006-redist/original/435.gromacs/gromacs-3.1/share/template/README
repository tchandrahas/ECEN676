Once installed, this directory contains a Makefile and 
a small program that you could use as a template when 
writing your own analysis software.

A Makefile.arch is created for each architecture you install 
(the first one is linked to Makefile) with the correct paths 
and libraries. If there is more than one, copy the one
that corresponds best to your computer.

----------------------------------------------------------

If you are reading this in the distribution directory, 
there will be a Makefile.am which automake uses to 
create a Makefile.in which in turn is converted to
a Makefile by the configure script. Note that this is
NOT the template makefile - it is called Template.mak,
and used to create Makefile.arch at build time.

You should NOT touch or copy Makefile.in unless you
really know what you are doing - it is a template file
used by the configure script to create the real Makefile.

If you want to use automake and autoconf yourself, look
in the contrib directory of the distribution.
