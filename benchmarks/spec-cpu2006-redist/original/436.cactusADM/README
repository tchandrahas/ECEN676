Original sources for 436.cactusADM

So, there are no distributions for Cactus and its thorns; you just check
stuff out of CVS.  To get the version used in CPU2006, you have to check
out Cactus from no later than 2002-01-29.  This checkout doesn't have
an "arrangements" directory, so you have to check the BenchADM components
out by hand; the GetCactus script won't do it for you.

In addition to that, you'll also need to check out CactusEinstein/Einstein.

Finally, to get some of the files that were generated, a build was done.
I've attempted to remove all of the object files and other non-source
stuff, so please forgive me if I missed one or two.
