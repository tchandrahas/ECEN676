The aim of this file is to describe the environment necessary to build
the CCTK on an NT (or Windows 2000) platform.

Apart from the required software noted in the manual, you must install
the cygwin package available from http://www.cygwin.com .

IMPORTANT: After installing Cygwin, you must make sure that the GNU
CPP is somewhere on your path, and that the directory path leading to
it contains no names containing un-escaped spaces - these would
confuse the autoconf program.  Failure to do this will result in
bizarre errors in the dependency generation.

Additionally, if you want the -clean, -realclean, and -cleandeps
targets to work, you need to make sure that the GNU find comes before
the microsoft find in your path.

In principle now all you need to do is start bash, checkout the CCTK,
and run make.

Please note that paths to additional include files or libraries must
contain no spaces.  However the INCLUDE and LIB environment variables,
which are used by the Windows compilers, may include spaces in path
names.  The INCLUDE environment variable MUST NOT, however, have a
semicolon (;) with no text after it, e.g. it must not end with a
semicolon.  This situation can be avoided by putting

INCLUDE="`echo $INCLUDE | sed -e 's/;\+/;/' | sed -e 's/;$//'`"

in your .bashrc .

Tested Software:
---------------

Cygwin:
------
Cygwin beta 20.1.
Cygwin 1.0 (but with an updated make, see below)
Cygwin 1.1.6

Perl:
----
perl 5.003_7 (Perl for Win32 build 312)
ActivePerl-5.6.0.620

C/C++:
-----
Microsoft Visual C 6.0
Intel C/C++ version 4.5 (configure with CC=icl CXX="icl /TP" )

Fortran:
-------
Digital Fortran 6.0 
Compaq Fortran 6.1
Intel Fortran 4.5 



KNOWN PROBLEMS:

Cygwin 1.0 comes with make 3.77 .  This dumps core in the make system
and should be updated to 3.79.1, or later.
