% Alternate environments/macros to define function descriptions
% (can/should be used to replace CCTKFunc environment)
% Jonathan Thornburg, 10 Nov 2001
%
% Usage:
%	\begin{FunctionDescription}{name}
%	\label{label}
%	Synopsis for this function			(running text rules)
%
%	\begin{Synopsis}{C}
%	text of C function synopsis			(running text rules)
%	\end{Synopsis}
%	\begin{Synopsis}{Fortran}
%	text of Fortran function synopsis		(running text rules)
%	\end{Synopsis}
%
%	\begin{ResultNote}
%	note to go at the beginning of all results	(running text rules
%	(this is optional; omit the ResultNote environment if not needed)
%	\end{ResultNote}
%	\begin{Result}{name or value (automatically in \tt font)}
%	desription of what the result means in general,
%	or of what this particular result value means	(running text rules)
%	\end{Result}
%
%	\begin{Parameter}{name (automatically in \tt font)}
%	desription of parameter				(running text rules)
%	\end{Parameter}
%	\begin{Parameter}{name2 (automatically in \tt font)}
%	desription of another parameter			(running text rules)
%	\end{Parameter}
%	\begin{Discussion}
%	discussion					(running text rules)
%	\NewPar
%	another paragraph of discussion			(running text rules)
%	\NewPar
%	yet another paragraph of discussion		(running text rules)
%	\end{Discussion}
%
%	\begin{SeeAlso}{name (automatically in \tt font)
%	cross-references to other function of that name (running text rules)
%	\end{SeeAlso}
%	\begin{SeeAlso}{name2 (automatically in \tt font)
%	cross-references to another function            (running text rules)
%	\end{SeeAlso}
%
%	\begin{Error}{error\_code (automatically in \tt font)}
%	description of what this error code means	(running text rules)
%	\end{Error}
%	\begin{Error}{error\_code2 (automatically in \tt font)}
%	description of what next error code means	(running text rules)
%	\end{Error}
%
%	\begin{Example}{C}
%	example C code					(running text rules)
%	\end{Example}
%	\begin{Example}{Fortran}
%	example Fortran code				(running text rules)
%	\end{Example}
%
% For arguments which are automatically in \tt font, \rm may be used
% to switch back to normal Roman font (eg for a numerical value), and
% $...$ may be used for math mode (eg  ($\ge 0$)  to mark a result
% which is always non-negative).
%
% Each "running text rules" item is the body of a latex environment,
% so it may include multiple lines or even paragraphs.  Normally
% underscore must be escaped (\_), but  \verb|...|  and/or
%	\begin{verbatim}
%	...
%	\end{verbatim}
% or similar constructs (which can't be used inside a macro argument)
% may also be used (in which case _ { } \ etc need not be escaped).
%
% Within a multi-paragraph "running text rules" item, \NewPar should be
% used at the start of each new paragraph.
%
% All the subsections are optional.
%
% Bugs:
% - There are various hardcoded lengths which should ideally be global
%   style parameters, and/or be determined from other style parameters
%   and \textwidth
% - It would be nice if we could avoid having to escape underscore
%   within arguments.
% - Error checking: if you have to ask, there isn't enough for you! :)
% - The vertical spacing is a bit of a hack.  Notably, having to use
%   \NewPar is an awful kludge -- \par should be redefined to do this
%   automagically.
% - There are no controls to prevent a page break falling between the
%   line "C" or "Fortran", and an immediately following example generated
%   by the Example subenvironment.  In fact, LaTeX seems to like doing
%   this. :(
% - It would be nice to have a "...continued" legend at the bottom of
%   all but the last page of a multi-page description.
% - The running header giving the function name, only appears for the
%   first page of a multi-page description.
% - In some ideal world, "See Also" would generate pdf hotlinks.
% - Footnotes don't work properly -- they come out at the bottom of
%   the individual section, not at the bottom of the page.
