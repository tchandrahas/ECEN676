<H4 ALIGN="CENTER">Makefile</H4>

The Makefile controls the building of Tonto.  To configure the Makefile, run
the <A HREF="configure.html">configure</A> script.  The Makefile requires GNU
make to work correctly, most other make programs will fail.  The configure
script checks for GNU make on your system.  <BR><BR>

Common options for make:<BR>
<TABLE COLS=2>
<TR><TD WIDTH=100>run_mol.x</TD><TD>make the main executable, run_mol.x</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>install</TD><TD>makes and installs run_mol.x</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>bla.o</TD><TD>builds the object file bla.o from bla.foo, useful for developers</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>clean</TD><TD>removes built program files</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>docsclean</TD><TD>removes built documentation files</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>distclean</TD><TD>removes all built files</TD></TR>
</TABLE><BR>

eg, "make install" will build and install run_mol.x.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

<B>Changing the Makefile</B><BR><BR>

You shouldn't have to normally edit the Makefile, although there may be some
things that need changing.  In particular, the F90 variable can take a few
options, FFAST for faster programs, FDEBUG to insert debugging code in
programs, and FPROF for timing programs.  eg,<BR>
F90 = $(FFAST) $(FPROF)<BR>
Usually the FFAST on its own is best, as it produces the fastest code.<BR><BR>

If you want to change the command line arguments to the Fortran compiler, then
it is safest to edit the appropriate file in the site_config directory, as if
you run configure again, the Makefile will get overwritten.
