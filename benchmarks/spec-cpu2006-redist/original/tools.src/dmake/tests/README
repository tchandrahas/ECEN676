DMAKE TESTCASES
===============

The testcases in this directory will be executed by "make check" in
this or the top directory.

Each test can be executed as a standalone script that will test the
first dmake that is found in the path. A different dmake to be tested
can be specified by setting the DMAKEPROG environment variable.

Example:
$ DMAKEPROG=../dmake ./misc-4
